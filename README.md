Digital music player

## Overview

More of a proof of concept than an exhaustive music library, this app mimics many functions found on modern web streaming apps. Users can play music, explore albums, rate albums, favorite songs, and search for music. We only have a few .mp3’s to pick from, but it’s a large enough sample size to see how the features work. Note that we do not persist any data (to include user information) - we’re only proofing our user interface.

## How to Run

From the command line, simply run:

```
$ grunt
```

Once the server is running, navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
